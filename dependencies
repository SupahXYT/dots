Here are the minimal amount of x dependencies needed:
libx11
libxinerama
libxrandr
libxft
xorg-server
xorg-xinit
xorg-xrandr

Other optional stuff:
hsetroot - wallpapers (I think this is the least bloated program but I may be wrong)
picom - composite manager (using xcompmgr is meme-level)
unclutter - Hide mouse when idle 
zbar - qr code reader
qrencode - qr encoder

# File manager
lf - cli based file manager (useful for playing media with mpv)

# Font 
ttf-jetbrains-mono - might retire this one I'm tired of looking at it
ttf-hack - replace above
ttf-mplus
ttf-sybola
ttf-adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts - to render moon ruins properly
