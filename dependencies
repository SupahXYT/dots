Here are the minimal amount of x dependencies needed:
libx11
libxinerama
libxrandr
libxft
xorg-server
xorg-xinit
xorg-xrandr

Other optional stuff:
hsetroot - wallpapers (I think this is the least bloated program but I may be wrong)
xcompmgr - transparency (anything else is bloat!)
unclutter - Hide mouse after 3 seconds of idle (might replace with a dwm patch but unclutter is such a small program it almost doesn't matter)

# Sound 
alsa-lib
alsa-utils
I think firefox installs pulseaudio anyways so it doesn't matter

# File manager
lf - cli based file manager (useful for playing media with mpv)

# Font 
ttf-jetbrains-mono - might retire this one I'm tired of looking at it
gnu-free-fonts - I needed something with unicode support
ttf-adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts - to render moon ruins properly 
ttf-adobe-source-han-sans-cn-fonts - for chinese (not like it makes a difference to me but I don't like having a bunch blocks when I'm on bilibili)
