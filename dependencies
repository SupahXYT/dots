Here are the minimal amount of x dependencies needed:
x11-libs/libX11
x11-base/xorg-server
x11-apps/xinit
x11-libs/libXrandr
x11-libs/libxft
x11-apps/xrandr

Other optional stuff:
hsetroot - wallpapers (I think this is the least bloated program but I may be wrong)
xcompmgr - transparency (anything else is bloat!)
x11-misc/unclutter - Hide mouse after 3 seconds of idle (will replace with a dwm patch later).
libxft - fancy unicode
I don't use xsetroot because I have dwmstatus already (no more bash script bloat!)

# Sound 
media-sound/alsa-utils
idk, I need to do some research to find a minimal but easy to use setup

# File manager
lf - cli based file manager (though I don't really use)

# Font 
jetbrains-mono - yep
